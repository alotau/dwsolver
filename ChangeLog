Change log for DWSOLVER.

- Version 1.2

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Found and fixed a memory allocation error in the subproblem thread.  Error
was only visible when there were more rows in the master problem than there
were variables in a given subproblem.  None of the prior examples exhibited this
behavior.

Added command line option to enforce integral constraints in the subproblems.
This is important if experimenting with the integerization heuristic (-i flag).

Added some comments throughout.

- Version 1.1
- Released October 15, 2010
- Contact Joseph.L.Rios@nasa.gov
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixed distribution package which was missing a header file.  Added automatic
detection of OSX build so that the --enable-named-semaphores flag is now not
necessary when building on Mac (it will be set automatically).

Initial release.  Dantzig-Wolfe Solver (DWSOLVER) is a general, parallel
implementation of the Dantzig-Wolfe Decomposition algorithm built upon the
GNU Linear Programming Kit (GLPK).  This is a command-line only tool.  All
input and output is file-based.  The user must supply a decomposed linear
program as input.  For details, execute "dwsolver --help".  For examples, see
the "examples" directory.  Current major limitations include the necessity of
bounded subproblems, necessity of every master variable appearing in exactly
one subproblem.  For a large number of problems, these are not major issues. 
For other problems, there are some workarounds as described in the examples.
