The Dantzig-Wolfe Solver program is a stand-alone implementation of the
Dantzig-Wolfe Decomposition algorithm.  The GNU Linear Programming Kit provides
the functions for all of the necessary linear programming (reading in problems,
performing the simplex algorithm, querying various LP data strucures, etc.).
This software also uses POSIX Threads (pthreads) for parallel solving of 
subproblems.  The implementation is general in that any linear program that can
be presented to the software in block-angular form (with some current 
limitations) can be solved.

All Dantzig-Wolfe source files created by the author begins with the prefix
"dw" while all other source files in the src/ directory are GLPK files.  All
GLPK files are provided as published by the author(s) of GLPK except for those
specified in the .patch file provided with this release.  The changes to GLPK
were made to implement a thread-friendly version of GLPK necessary for 
implementation of a parallel Dantzig-Wolfe algorithm.
