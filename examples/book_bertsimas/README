Specifically, this is example 6.2 on pages 245 through 246.

To run this example with a single subproblem as shown in textbook:

<PATH_TO_DANTZIG_WOLFE_EXECUTABLE> -g guide_single

To run this example with two subproblems:

<PATH_TO_DANTZIG_WOLFE_EXECUTABLE> -g guide_double

To run this example with three subproblems:

<PATH_TO_DANTZIG_WOLFE_EXECUTABLE> -g guide_triple
