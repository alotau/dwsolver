The problem presented in this directory is from:

Dantzig, George and Thapa, Mukund N. Linear Programming: Theory and Extensions.
	Springer. 2003.

Specifically, this is example 10.5/10.6 on pages 290 through 298.

Since the current implementation of dwsolver does not allow for unbounded
subproblems, upper bounds have been added to the subproblem files.  These bounds
were chosen through quick examination of the connecting constraints in the
master problem.  No variable could be valued over 64 and still satisfy the 
connecting constraints.  Thus, an upper bound of 65 is placed on all of the
decision variables in each of the subproblem files.

To run this example:
