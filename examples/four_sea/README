The problem in this directory is an instance of the model originally published
by Bertsimas and Stock-Patterson for Traffic Flow Management of the National
Airspace System.

D. Bertsimas and S. Stock-Patterson.  The Air Traffic Flow Management Problem
   with En Route Capacities.  Operations Research, 46(3):406-422, May-June 1998.
   
This model was implemented for the research completed in several studies by Rios
and Ross:

Delay Optimization for Airspace Capacity Management with Runtime and Equity
   Considerations.  In Proceedings of AIAA Guidance, Navigation, and Control
   Conference and Exhibit, Hilton Head, South Carolina, August 2007.

Solving High-Fidelity, Large-Scale Traffic Flow Management Problems in Reduced
   Time.  In Proceedings of AIAA Aviation Technology, INtegration and Operations
   Conference, Anchorage, Alaska, September 2008.

Massively Parallel Dantzig-Wolfe Decomposition Applied to Traffic Flow 
   Scheduling.  Journal of Aerospace Computing, Information, and Communication.
   7(1):32-45, January 2010.
   

The instance provided here involves 8 aircraft departing the same airport at the
same time destined for the same arrival airport along the same trajectory.  This
is a toy example to illustrate that 2 of the flights must be held in order to 
satisfy the arrival capacity constraints of the arrival airport which is set to
a value of 6.  This results in a total delay of 12 minutes.
