The problem presented in this directory is from:

Mitchell, John. An example of Dantzig-Wolfe Decomposition. Accessed online
     at http://www.rpi.edu/~mitchj/handouts/egdcmp/ on Aug 18, 2010.

Note that the problem was changed slightly to avoid the unbounded subproblem.
Since it was known a priori that the optimal value for the unbounded variable
was 1, an upper bound on that variable was set well above that.  Otherwise, 
the problem is implemented as described on Mitchell's website.

The optimal value is -5.

To run this example:

<PATH_TO_DANTZIG_WOLFE_EXECUTABLE> -g guide_file
