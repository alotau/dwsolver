The problem presented in this directory is from:

Trick, Michael. A Consultants Guide to Solving Large Problems. Accessed online

This problem is a good example of the need for every variable to exist in a 
subproblem.  As presented online, Trick leaves x1 in the master problem.
Clearly, this is mathematically reasonable, however, the dwsolver software
expects no master variables except those found in subproblems.  The simple
fix to this problem is to create a new subproblem containing only variable
x1.

To run this example:
